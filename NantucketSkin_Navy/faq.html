<ul class="about">
<li class="about"><span class="listheader">What is a FAQ?</span> A F.A.Q. is a list of Frequently Asked Questions, along with their answers.</li>
<li class="about"><span class="listheader">Why would I want to make a FAQ?</span> You might find that there are several commonly asked questions about your EFG. If you make a FAQ you can point visitors there instead of typing the same response over and over in an email. Or better yet, users might read the FAQ on their own and never need to bother you, the author, to answer that question they had.</li>
<li class="about"><span class="listheader">FAQ 3?</span> You can change the style code in nantucket.css. Style code controls things like font size, font color, bold and italics, and more.</li>
</ul>
